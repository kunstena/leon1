As the evironmental movement targets the financing Wells Fargo, Chase, Citybank, etc.,   give the fossil fuel industry, the government continues its massive subsidies of the fossil fuel extractive industry.

Usually, the federal government taxes shipping company using waterways a fee proportionate to the tonnage of what
they ship. Not so with oil companies. Similar to this is the $107 million<a href=" https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0a10#references">

These are subsidies, where oil companies carve out exemptions for themselves—usually with the help of lawmakers—to pay
<a href="https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/energy-economics/royalty-relief">significantly lower royalties</a> rates on the oil and gas they extract. For example, the Lost Royalties on Offshore Drilling for Leases Issued from
1996 through 2000 subsidy came as a result of the 1995 “Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act,” 
something that to this day deprives taxpayers of $1.1 billion each year.

 Big Oil Lobby Spending Millions to Gut Key Build Back Better Climate Provisions: Report 
 https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/10/06/big-oil-lobby-spending-millions-gut-key-build-back-better-climate-provisions-report


 Modification of the dual capacity rules would restrict companies from 
claiming foreign royalty payments as a credit against U.S. taxes.   

Another corporate handout, the so-called dual capacity loophole, is "a longstanding gimmick" wherein fossil fuel giants
"artificially inflat[e] their foreign tax bills" to evade U.S. taxes.

Although they are permitted to claim tax credits for taxes paid to foreign governments, U.S. companies are not allowed
to do so for non-tax payments such as royalties.
"In practice, however, the categories often are commingled—particularly when companies make a single combined payment
including both taxes and fees," the report explains. "A foreign country may even try to disguise non-tax payments as a tax,
knowing that in many cases a multinational company may receive a foreign tax credit from its home country. Existing
regulation gives dual capacity taxpayers vast latitude to assert what portions of their payments are taxes eligible to offset
U.S. tax bills." 
Eliminating the dual capacity loophole would raise at least an additional $1.4 billion, according to the Biden administration,
while the Joint Committee on Taxation puts the figure somewhere between $5.6 billion and $13.1 billion.
The report points out that "the estimates vary so widely in part because we have precious little visibility into Big Oil's
payments to governments—and that's just how the companies want it."
